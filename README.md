# Duncan Ritchie’s apprenticeship account.
I studied for twelve weeks at the web development bootcamp Code Nation, then secured an apprenticeship at the R&D company Information Catalyst and went back to the bootcamp for a further twelve weeks as part of my course. This GitHub account is for my apprenticeship work — mainly from my second stint at Code Nation. For other code I’ve written, see [my primary account](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie).
